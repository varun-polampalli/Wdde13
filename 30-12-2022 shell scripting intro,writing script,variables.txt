Linux 

Shell scripting 

linux :-
Kernal+GNU

KERNAL :- kernal is a heart of the operating system, kernal will act like a interface between shell and
          hardware.

shell :-
-------

GUI :- Graphical user interface... 

If i click on any task by using gui the operation will hit to shell , shell will execute the task
it will send Request to kernal in binary language ..


use of shell scripting in our it indstry :
----------------------------------------------
as a linux admin we need to monitor the servers and systems 

disk spaces, cpu utilization 

we will write a script 


set up the server 

jenkins 

install the jenkins repo
key
epel
java
jenkins

package managers 
update 

programs :- we need to follow the syntax , compilers and interpretor 
 scripting lang  :- scripting will not follow the syntax ,intrepretor 

discuss how to write a shell script:
----------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash     #shibang line  

 
echo "this is the working directory"
pwd

echo "user name"
whoami 

Package managers :

linux,centos :- yum 
ubunut :- apt 
--------------------
yum update -y

echo "update is done"

yum install java -y
echo "java installation is done"



Varibles :
-----------
Variable is a named memeory allocation which is used to store the data and it can be chnaged n number 
times during a execution.

x=10  c=25

echo $x

$ is used to call the varible

nano :- ctrl+s, ctrl+x

vi :- esc :wq


3 types :
----------
1.Environmental variables

unset 

readonly 

a=20

unset a 

echo the value of a is $a

-===========================
readonly :
----------
x=17
readonly x
x=13
echo $x

Combine both unset and readonly 
-----------------------------------
b=13
readonly b
unset b

output:-
-------------
line 3: unset: b: cannot unset: readonly variable

b is readonly we are not having write permission for the variable we cant able to modify

2.System defined variables:
------------------------------
In our system predefined variables 

HOME
echo $PWD
echo $HOME
echo $HOSTNAME
echo $OSTYPE

3.user defined variables 
--------------------------------

wish=Advance happy new year to all
year=2023

echo $wish $year 


shell script will support string 

read :- it is used to take the input from the user

Addition
=========================================
echo "enter the value of x"
read x       #collect the input from the user

echo "enter the value of y"
read y       #collect the input from the user

sum=`expr $x + $y`   #by using expression we are going to add the values 

echo the addition of x and y is  $sum 

echo enter the value of a
read a

echo enter the value of b
read b

sum=`expr $a + $b`

echo $sum


echo "enter the value of x" 
read x  
echo "enter the value of y" 
read y  
sum=`expr $x + $y` 
echo $sum

echo enter a 
read a 
echo enter b 
read b 
sum=`expr $a + $b` 
echo $sum
